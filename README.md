### Description
	Our group decided to work on the MyDiscussionForum website that allows registered users to engage in online discussions and users without registration are only able to access read-only for the discussions. The overall platform will be similar to forums such as Reddit and HackerNews. The primary goal is to provide a space for registered users to engage in discussions by posting stories, making comments, and exchanging ideas while unregistered users will have the ability to browse and search for content but won't be able to participate actively in discussions. Additionally, the administrator can delete registered users’ posts or comments, which works like censorship.
### Requirements list

1. User Signup:

- New users can register by providing a unique username and password.

2. Login Authentication:

3. Post Stories

- Users logged in with username and password can post any texts or a limited number of pictures with a title and are able to tag for multiple categories.

4. Edit profiles

- Registered users logged in can update their profiles, including profile pictures, username and password reset.

5. Comments

- Registered users can leave comments on posts.
- Unregistered users are only allowed to view the comments, so are the admins.
- The admin can also decide if deleting the comments

6. Search

- Registered, unregistered users and admin are all allowed to search users by user id or username and search posts by tags or categories.


7. Categorization

- Registered users can categorize their posts by adding tags (unregistered users can’t post).


### Additional/undecided Features
1. Notification System:
- Registered users receive notifications for comments, replies, and other relevant activities.
2. LIKE system:
- Registered users can like the posts, #thumbsup increase.
